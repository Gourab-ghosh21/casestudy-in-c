Start

Input x1, y1, x2, y2

Calculate difference in x-coordinates:
dx = x2 − x1

Calculate difference in y-coordinates:
dy = y2 − y1

Calculate absolute value of dx:
abs_dx = sqrt(dx × dx)

Calculate absolute value of dy:
abs_dy = sqrt(dy × dy)

Calculate Manhattan distance:
total_distance = abs_dx + abs_dy

Display total_distance

✅ Algorithm – Case Study 4: Convert Seconds to H:M:S

Start

Input total_seconds

Calculate hours:
hours = total_seconds / 3600

Calculate remaining seconds:
remaining = total_seconds % 3600

Calculate minutes:
minutes = remaining / 60

Calculate seconds:
seconds = remaining % 60

Display hours, minutes, and seconds

✅ Algorithm – Case Study 5: Truncate Float to Two Decimal Places

Start

Input raw_balance

Multiply balance by 100:
temp = raw_balance × 100

Convert to integer to remove decimals:
integer_part = (int) temp

Divide by 100 to restore decimal places:
final_balance = integer_part / 100

Display final_balance
